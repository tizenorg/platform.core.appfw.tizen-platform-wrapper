This is a tool for designing and using /etc/tizen-platform.conf file.

It produces the program tzplatform-tool that allow users to check and
pretty format the /etc/tizen-platform.conf file. That tool is also used
to generate header and source file for processing /etc/tizen-platform.conf 
file.

It also exports files to handle /etc/tizen-platform.conf file. These are
used by some other projetcs as tize-platform-config that are the 
implementation.
